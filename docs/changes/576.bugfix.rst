Now ``showyourwork setup`` accepts a new option ``--action-version`` to specify the version of the GitHub Action to use in the generated workflows.
If not provided, it defaults to the latest release or the latest dev commit if newer.
The existing option ``--action-spec`` still allows to specify the remote version of showyourwork to use for the workflow runs,
but if not provided now it defaults to whatever local version is used to instantiate the project and not to the latest release as before.
