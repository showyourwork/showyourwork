Templates
=========

You can start working on your new project from a template ready to use.
If you already know what you need, this is a better alternative to using
the ``showyourwork setup`` command and starting from scratch.

Access your template of choice from this gallery and click on "Use this template"
to create a new remote repository with the same files and directory structure.

You can then clone it to your local machine and start editing!
